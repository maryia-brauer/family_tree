Console project.
When program is run, user is presented with the following options that repeat
after any action is done:
1 - Add people; 2 - Print info; 0 - Exit

Option 1 - Add people
Once this option is selected, the user can input information about people as
follows:
"Mary(F) has 3 brothers - Jim, Jack, Bill"
"Jim(M) has 2 daughters - Annie, Katie"
"Owen(M) also has a father - Buckie"
Only "traditional" relationships (one husband and one wife; parents are
one male, one female; a person does not have step-parents).

Option two - Print info
Once this option is selected, the user is presented with all the people in the
program to choose from. Example:
1 - Mary
2 - Jim
3 - Manny
4 - Ranny
5 - Felipe
After choosing a person, the program prints out information about the person
and all the first level relationships - to father, mother, brothers, sisters, sons,
daughters.

Option 3 - Exit
This option might be handled differently - the user might be prompted with an
option to start over or to save information in a file/database or simply finish the
program without any extra specifics.
